This project repository is based on personal research content.
The programs are an inspiration towards becoming a well skilled software engineer. They are geered towards personal growth in programming and software development. Content mastery for the purpose of delivery is key in the learning modules employed.
They range from simple to complex codes each performing a specific task.
